      <description>Models with this special rule may cast one spell at any point during their activation before attacking.

To cast a spell select one from the psychic’s army list, pick a target in line of sight, and roll D6+X. If the result is equal to or higher than the number in brackets then you may resolve the spell’s effects.

Spells may target a single unit, or split their hits/wounds or bonus/penalties evenly among all friendly/enemy units within 6” of a single model (target picks how). Enemy psychics within 18” and line of sight may also roll D6+X at the same time, and if the result is higher than that of the casting psychic, then the spell’s effects are blocked instead.

Note that each psychic may only either try to cast a spell or try to block a spell each round.</description>
